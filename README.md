# **Citibike Analysis (New York)**

## **Purpose**
This project aims to analyse the bikeshare data from Citibike New York with Tableau and Pandas.

## **Background**

The data was downloaded from the Citbike website for August 2019. The CSV file was modified using Pandas to change the data type of the trip duration column. The modified file is then loaded to Tableau for data visualisation purposes.

## **Findings/Results**
Below are the findings of our Tableau data analysis:
- The lower Manhattan area is the stop starting location

- Males are predominantly using Citibike service.

- The number of checkouts is highest in the morning.

- The pattern for the time of checkout is the same for males and females. The categorical difference is that males are outnumbering female riders.

- The morning time (7 am to 9 am) and the evening time (5 pm to 7 pm) have the highest number of weekly trips per hour. That shows that people use the Citibike service for their rides to and from work. 

The weekend hours also look busy, which shows that even tourists are more likely to use it for leisure activities.

- As concluded earlier, Male riders use the Citibike service more than female riders. However, when it comes to bike ride time, it is the same for male and female riders.

- When it comes to the number of trips, Thursdays and Fridays are the busiest days of the week.

## **Summary**

The analysis and visualisation illustrated in this project can be beneficial for the same bikshare service project in De Moine, Iowa. Although not all the findings can be extrapolated for De Moine, considering the difference in population, demographics and weather, we can still utilise the results and make an informed decision for the bikeshare start-up in De Moine, Iowa.
